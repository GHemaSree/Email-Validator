# Email Validator Program in C

## Description
This C program allows the user to enter an email address and validates it based on the following criteria:
1. The email must contain exactly one `@` symbol.
2. There must be at least one `.` (dot) after the `@` symbol.
3. The `.` (dot) should not immediately follow the `@` symbol.
4. The `.` (dot) must not be the last character in the email.

The program provides specific error messages when the email is invalid, such as:
- "There must be exactly one '@' symbol."
- "There must be at least one '.' after the '@'."
- "The '.' must not immediately follow '@'."
- "The '.' must not be the last character."

## Requirements
- C compiler (e.g., GCC)
